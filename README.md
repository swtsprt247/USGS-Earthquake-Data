# USGS Earthquake Data
The USGS is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment; and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes.


# Rationale
The goal of this project is to visualize the earthquake data. The hope is that being able to visualize the data will educate the public and other government organizations on issues facing our planet.
